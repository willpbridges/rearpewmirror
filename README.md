# Rear Pew Mirror

This repo was made to show off the C# scripts my team developed for Rear Pew Mirror, a game we developed over the course of a semester for a class. The game was developed using Unity collab, so there are no commits or contributions here. This repo doesn't have any Unity project files, only scripts. You can find out more about the game here: https://www.willbridgesgames.com/rpm.html
